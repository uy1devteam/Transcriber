# Transcriber

Is a simple tool to transcribe audio files to text. Available as [streamlit app](https://transcriber.streamlit.app).
Currently based on OpenAi's whisper model but plans to move to a faster and more robust engine like Meta's XLSR or integrate engine selection feature.

<!-- Plans to integrate speaker recognition and diarization  -->
